# Hackbright Winter 2016 (January - March)

## Background
[Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com) is a 12-week Software Engineering Fellowship for women.
I attended Hackbright Academy in the winter of 2016.

This is a compilation of the code I pushed to Github during my time at Hackbright.
I have a separate git submodule for each project/lesson, with respositories organised under the Github organisation, [doria-hackbright](https://github.com/doria-hackbright).

## How to navigate

### Pair Programming
This is code worked on during pair programming sessions during class. Not all pair programming code is pushed to Github, only some select projects.

**A note on the code: Since all of the pair programming code is written on Hackbright computers, the user pushing the code will appear as the Hackbright Github user.**

### Skills Assessments
These are weekly assessments based on the key lessons for that week. Lessons are done through pair programming during the week.

### Hackbright Project
In the latter 5 weeks of the program, we worked on a large personal project.
Mine was an "office jukebox", where the user can create a "jukebox session", which returns a unique URL.
They can then send this URL to other users who can upvote, downvote, and add songs, and everyone would have a single shared session.
This is created using libspotify, Flask, Postgres, and Skeleton for the UI.
Unfortunately the project has gone completely unmaintained, and I believe libspotify is entirely deprecated, so this project will need to be recreated in order to work.

## Etc.
If you're interested in a detailed account of my experience at Hackbright, I kept [a blog](https://doriable.github.io/tags/hackbright/) of my experience.
Feel free to reach out with any questions.
